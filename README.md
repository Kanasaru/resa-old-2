# resa
Simple and very straight forward. You are a lord or king or whatever and get into an unknown, island based, world. You got your ship, some materials and some gold. Now you need to develop your chosen island into a great trading and self-sustaining city. If you lose all your money or your population ist starving to death or leaves your city for other reasons you are defeated.

I try to mix everything I like about the ‘good old’ strategic games I’ve played so much in childhood. More information about the 'concept' can be found in the [playbook](doc/playbook.md).

__By the way__: This is my third try on this. First was an isometric version in python with pygame and second was an isometric version in C with SDL, both without a concept. Now it's 2.5D and with a playbook, but still in C with SDL. Let's see how far we get this time.

# Documentation
On [my website](https://bitbyteopen.org) I'll **try** to write about the development process. Everything else, at least that's how I initially determined it, goes into the documentation. Simple markdown files are used for this.
